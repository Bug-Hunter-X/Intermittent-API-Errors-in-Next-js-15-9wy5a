# Intermittent API Errors in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 applications: handling intermittent errors from an API route.  The API route simulates occasional failures, highlighting the need for robust error handling on the client-side.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` route simulates an API call that might fail with a 500 error (Internal Server Error) 20% of the time.  The `components/MyComponent.js` fetches data from this API.  When the API fails, the component's behavior is unpredictable;  it might display a loading indicator indefinitely or crash.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling in the client-side component:

1. **Use `try...catch`:** Wrap the API call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the fetch.
2. **Check `res.ok`:**  After fetching, check `res.ok` to ensure the API response indicates success.
3. **Handle HTTP errors:** If `res.ok` is false, throw an error to be caught by the `catch` block.
4. **Loading state:** Use a loading state to indicate when the data is being fetched. 
5. **Display error messages:** Gracefully display error messages to the user when an error occurs.
6. **Consider retry logic**: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient network issues.

This improved approach ensures a smoother user experience even when the API encounters temporary issues.
